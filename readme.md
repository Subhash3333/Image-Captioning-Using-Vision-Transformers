## Running Instructions

### Part A

The Part A notebook can be run on Kaggle directly. All the required imports are already present in the notebook itself.

Only issue that might come up is that the dataset may not be shared along with the notebook. It is a simple upload of the dataset proviede in the problem statement. It can be accessed here [deeplearning dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/themockingjay1013/deeplearning). So if you get an issue with missing files, please go to this dataset, create a notebook using this dataset and then import our notebook.

### Part B

The Part A notebook can be run on Kaggle directly. All the required imports are already present in the notebook itself.

Only issue that might come up is that the dataset may not be shared along with the notebook. It is a simple upload of the dataset proviede in the problem statement. It can be accessed here [deeplearning dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/themockingjay1013/deeplearning). So if you get an issue with missing files, please go to this dataset, create a notebook using this dataset and then import our notebook. After that, please replace the in the path of the files `/kaggle/input/dataset-dl/custom_captions_dataset` by `/kaggle/input/custom_captions_dataset` in the notebook at all places. Then the notebook should run without any issues.

## Report and Notebook

Please refer to the report.pdf for the detailed report of the project. Also, the notebooks are present in the repository for reference.
